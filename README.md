# p5-simple-moba-game
A simple multiplayer online battle arena (moba) game coded in Javascript using p5.js. The players must kill all the enemy's minions before they can try to damage the moving nexus. If the player is shot several times, they are "killed" and prevented from moving for a certain amount of time. The minions spawn on intervals with a max of 3 minions per player. The players can stand on top of a gold tile in the middle of the arena to gain gold. They can use that gold to upgrade the amount of shots they can shoot. Player who breaks the enemy player's nexus first wins.
